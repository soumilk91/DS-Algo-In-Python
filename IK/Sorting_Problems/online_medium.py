Question:Given a list of numbers, the task is to insert these numbers into a stream and find the median of the stream
after each insertion. If the median is a non-integer, consider itâ€™s floor value.

The median of a sorted array is defined as the middle element when the number of elements is odd and the mean of the
middle two elements when the number of elements is even.

Eg:
{
"stream": [3, 8, 5, 2]
}
Output: [3, 5, 5, 4]
Iteration	Stream	Sorted Stream	Median
1	         [3]	     [3]	      3
2	        [3, 8]	    [3, 8]	    (3 + 8) / 2 => 5
3	       [3, 8, 5]	[3, 5, 8]	    5
4	      [3, 8, 5, 2]	[2, 3, 5, 8]	(3 + 5) / 2 => 4
