Question:

Given four billion of 32-bit integers, return any one thatâ€™s not among them. Assume you have 1 GiB (10243 bytes) of memory.

Follow up: what if you only have 10 MiB of memory?

Example One
{
"arr": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
Output:

4
Any number in the [4 .. 232) range is a correct answer.

Example Two
{
"arr": [4294967295, 399999999, 0]
}
Output:

1
Here again 1 is just one of many correct answers.
