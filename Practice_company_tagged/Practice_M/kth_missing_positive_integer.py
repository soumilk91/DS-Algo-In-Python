Question:
Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.



Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.

            # which are missing before arr[pivot]

            # Otherwise, go left.
            else:
                right = pivot - 1

        # At the end of the loop, left = right + 1,
        # and the kth missing is in-between arr[right] and arr[left].
        # The number of integers missing before arr[right] is
        # arr[right] - right - 1 -->
        # the number to return is
        # arr[right] + k - (arr[right] - right - 1) = k + left
