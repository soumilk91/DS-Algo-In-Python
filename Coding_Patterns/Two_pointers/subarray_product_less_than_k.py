Question:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the
elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
Output: 0

class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Handle edge cases where k is 0 or 1 (no subarrays possible)
        if k <= 1:
            return 0

        total_count = 0
        product = 1

        # Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window
        left = 0
        for right, num in enumerate(nums):
            product *= num  # Expand the window by including the element at the right pointer

            # Shrink the window from the left while the product is greater than or equal to k
            while product >= k:
                product //= nums[left]  # Remove the element at the left pointer from the product
                left += 1

            # Update the total count by adding the number of valid subarrays with the current window size
            total_count += right - left + 1  # right - left + 1 represents the current window size

        return total_count
