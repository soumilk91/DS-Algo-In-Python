Question:
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

eg:
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        # We will use Binary Search for this Question
        low = 0
        high = n
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            temp = guess(mid)
            if temp < 0:
                high = mid - 1
            elif temp > 0:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
