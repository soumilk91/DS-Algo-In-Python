Question:
Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.



Example 1:


Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
