### My Plan to Study 
Here's a **comprehensive and actionable coding interview prep plan** based on your strategy:

---

### 🧠 **Phase 1: Master Core Data Structures & Algorithms**

For each topic:

* **Study**: Learn concepts, implementation, edge cases.
* **Practice**: Solve **10 curated problems**.
* **Revise**: Add key patterns or tricks to a personal notes doc.

#### ✅ Topics List (Expanded)

1. **Arrays**
2. **Strings**
3. **Hash Tables / Maps / Sets**
4. **Two Pointers & Sliding Window**
5. **Stacks**
6. **Queues / Deques**
7. **Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Cycle)**
8. **Recursion & Backtracking**
9. **Binary Search**
10. **Sorting & Merging Intervals**
11. **Trees**
12. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**
13. **Tries (Prefix Trees)**
14. **Heaps / Priority Queues**
15. **Graphs (BFS, DFS, Union-Find, Topo Sort)**
16. **Greedy Algorithms**
17. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
18. **Bit Manipulation**
19. **Math & Geometry**
20. **Design (LRU Cache, Rate Limiter, etc.)**

> 📌 *Resources*: Neetcode, Leetcode Explore, and "Patterns" from Sean Prashad's Leetcode Guide.

---

### 🚀 **Phase 2: Blind Series**

Once all the core topics are done:

1. **Blind 75**

   * Focus on patterns & time-space tradeoffs.
   * Aim: 2-3 problems/day, finish in \~4 weeks.

2. **Blind 150**

   * Continue from Blind 75. It’s more depth.
   * Mix in problems from **System Design-ready** companies like Google, Meta, Amazon.

---

### 🏢 **Phase 3: Company-Specific Prep**

When you get interviews:

* Go to the **LeetCode “Company” tag** section.
* Solve **Top 50 Tagged Problems** per company.
* Prioritize:

  * Google/Amazon/Meta/Netflix/Microsoft
  * Then others like DoorDash, Uber, etc.

---

### 🏗️ **System Design (30 min/day)**

Suggested Plan:

* **Week 1–2**: Basics — Scalability, Latency, Load Balancing, Caching, DBs
* **Week 3–4**: Common Systems — URL Shortener, Twitter Feed, Rate Limiter
* **Ongoing**: One new system every 2-3 days + revisit 1 old one/week

---

### 🔁 Review & Tracking

* Keep a **Notion, Google Doc, or Spreadsheet** with:

  * Topics Covered
  * Problems Solved
  * Difficult Problems to Revisit
* Revisit **hard problems** every 2 weeks.
